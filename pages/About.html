          I'm Srilekha, a Java developer based in Adelaide, Australia. I like to
          crack a career in Software development in here as I was from India. I
          am currently working in nology 12 week software training program,
          working towards becoming a full-stack developer.

          Outside of tech stuff, I am a foodie. I like to travel a lot on land
          because I am so scared of flights.
