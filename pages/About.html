          I'm Srilekha, a Java developer based in Adelaide, Australia. I Studied
          Information Technology(IT) in India. I worked for Tata Consultancy
          Services(TCS) for about three years. Even though working for three
          years I havent gained much knowledge on the topics as I was moved to 4
          different projects and didnt have consistancy at all. After getting
          married, I moved to Australia and wanted to learn tech stack. So, I
          came across _nology through linkedIn searches and got a chance in
          nology 12 week software training program.

          Outside of tech stuff, I am a foodie. I like to travel a lot on land
          because I am so scared of flights.
