Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio which is a representation of my skills, projects and my contact details.

The project is hosted on github pages on https://srilekha25.github.io/portfolio/

![Portfolio](Images/portfolio.png)

# Overview

To design a responsive portfolio in HTML and CSS. 

# Requirements

# MVP

- You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
- In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
- You are to use SCSS for styling.
- !!! Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good on mobile phones.
  VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops (use media queries for at least checking whether the device is a mobile phone)
- You must use BEM naming convention for scss selectors.
- You must have the project hosted using github pages.

Your Portfolio should have the following section:

- A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
- An About page/section with a little bit about you
- A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
- A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
- A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link
